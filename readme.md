# blockchain-in-js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/amazingandyyy/blockchain-in-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/amazingandyyy/blockchain-in-js)

This is an afternoon-project, a blockchain built in node, supporting PoW.

### Why Node
Node itself is a more beautiful, flexible and powerful language for internet project, again, I want to show my love to js.

### Why a Blockchain from scratch
When it comes to blockchain, most developers only learn **how to do Dapp** with ethereum, neo, or other existing infrastructure-completed project... They are fine, but using them will only let you know what you can do with them, as a result, you cannot really get the idea what you can do with blockchain itself, and what you can apply the blockchain mindset to other software projects. I think there is a better way to understand blockchain itself - to build a chain from scratch

## This is a lovely demo for 
- How Blocks, Chain,, Keys, Nodes, transaction work with each others.
- How to do them in Node
- How to resolve basic conflicts in blockchain
- How to use sha256 to do PoW(Proof of Work)
- No a demo for 
  - signatures
  - address
  - production setup
  - make you a blockchain expert

## Run it on your machine
```
$ npm clone https://github.com/amazingandyyy/blockchain-in-js.git
$ npm i
$ npm run dev // default on port 3000

<!-- to run more nodes -->
$ npm run nodes // default on port 3000
$ npm run nodes 3000 // listening on port 3000
$ npm run nodes 3001 // listening on port 3001
$ npm run nodes 3002 // listening on port 3002
```

## HTTP Endpoints
```
GET /blockchain // see the link-list itself
GET /blockchain/mine // find the next special hash
POST /blockchain/transactions // add new data to the chain 
GET /blockchain/nodes/resolve // fetch the longest chain
POST /blockchain/nodes/register // add nodes urls
GET /blockchain/nodes // get a list of all nodes
```


### There are many can be done: 
Please feel free to fork, clone or send me PR
- use socket instead of http, to broadcast state
- implement signature, public, private key, user address ideneity system
- proof of work and rewards system
- PoS, or other dBFT methods
- dockernized
- interactive wrappers, helper libraries...
